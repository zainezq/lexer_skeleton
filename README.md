# Simple Lexers for Learning Purposes

This repository contains two example lexers written in C that are intended for learning purposes. The lexers are not complete and do not handle all possible cases. They serve as a starting point for understanding the basics of lexer implementation in the context of compiler construction.

## Usage

1. **Compile the Lexers:**

   ```bash
   gcc lexer.c -o lexer
   gcc lexer2.c -o lexer2
   ```

2. **Run the Lexers:**

   ```bash
   ./lexer hello.c
   ./lexer2 hello.c
   ```

   The lexers will read an input file and print the identified tokens to the console.

## Important Note

These lexers are incomplete and may not handle all possible input cases. They are meant for educational purposes, providing a foundation for those who want to learn about lexer design and implementation (and possibly compiler designing).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic structure and logic of a lexer.
- Explore tokenization of simple constructs such as integers, floats, and identifiers.
- Recognize the challenges and considerations in lexer development.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to these lexers by addressing their limitations, adding new features, or enhancing their robustness. Contributions that help learners understand the principles behind lexing are highly encouraged.

## Disclaimer

These lexers are not intended for production use. If you require a production-ready lexer, consider using established tools and libraries such as Flex.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
